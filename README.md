# Logcli

logcli is tool for easy working with logs but its opionated my work flow to working with logs looks like
fetch json logs from lines and than push it to elasticsearch for future analytics my logs stored
as JSON objects. Example how my logs look like
```text
I, [2019-05-09T17:00:16.049805 #57671]  INFO -- : {"evt_type":"FileUpload":"info","time":"2019-05-09T15:00:16+0000","payload":{"time_elapsed_human":"00:00:00.874","time_elapsed":0.874553},"trace_id":"cd5916a6-14b7-4628-bdda-334e4285a4e0"}
```
as you can see there a log prefixer like `I, [2019-05-09T17:00:16.049805 #57671]  INFO -- : `
that's why its not a JSON but than goes a JSON object that I want to extract
I'm using this command to extract JSON from log line
```bash
logcli extract_json --filenames=log1.log log2.log
```

as result tool create in the SAME directory files with names `log1_json.log, log2_json.log`

than I'm push data to ES for analytics using ES + Kibana

```bash
logcli elasticsearch --filenames=events_json.log --elasticsearch_url=http://localhost:9201
```

```bash
logcli --help #for more command line options
```

tool using batch API and push 100 records and the time

Pretty dummy stuff hah
